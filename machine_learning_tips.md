# Machine Learning Tips

## Approach problems in this order from Josh Gordon.

1. Carefully think about what you want to predict, what success means, and how you will evaluate it.

2. Carefully collect & clean data, and write code to detect errors in your data processing pipeline.

3. Begin with simple features, and a baseline model (say, a linear classifier).

4. Run end-to-end experiments. Are your predictions useful? Do they make sense?

5. Analyze errors. What kind of mistakes does your model make? Why? What can you do to prevent them? Get to know your data.

6. Improve your features. If you use complex features, are they likely to generalize (e.g., also be useful on your test data)?

7. Consider using a more complex model. Switch from a linear classifier to a DNN (be careful not to overfit). If you want to simulate production code, you get to use your test data only once.

## Tip 1: 

Don't agonize over the number of layers, or neurons per layer (it's fun to hack on these, but it's usually not that important). There are many possible architectures that will give similar accuracy. Remember: the goal is to develop a model that works well in production.

TLDR: 

Design for simplicity and reliability first, and you're more likely to get a good result.
What kind of accuracy improvement can I expect from...?

## Tip 2: 

Focus on your data, and your features. They're almost always more important than tuning your model. Here's the relative accuracy improvment you can expect from each activity.

## Improving your features

- Reasonable features +50%
- Tuned features +20%
- Amazing features +10%

## Improving your model

- Baseline model +50%
- Tuned model +10%
- Amazing model +5%
