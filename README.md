# My Deep Learning Resources

This README is how and where I learn deep learning from the internet. There are many resources out there and normally you could just google it, but I digested and kept the resources that I like or suggest here. I'll constantly update the list here, since I am constantly learning.

### Courses Online
Machine Learning
- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng on Coursera - This course is considered the MUST take if you wanna learn machine learning. Andrew uses easy understanding knowledge to bring you to the machine learning world.

Convolutional Neural Networks
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/syllabus) by Fei-Fei Li, Justin Johnson and Serena Yeung in Stanford - At the time of this post, the course is taught in 2017. If you want to learn the latest course, just google CS231n.

Reinforcement Learning
- [UCL Course on RL](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) by David Silver in UCL - Big giant of reinforcement learning. This course was taught when David Silver is in UCL.
